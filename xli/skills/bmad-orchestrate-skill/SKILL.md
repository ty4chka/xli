# BmadOrchestrate

Accelerates BMAD sprints by analyzing story dependencies, identifying parallelization opportunities, and orchestrating concurrent execution across git worktrees with tmux and Claude Code.

## Customization

**Before executing, check for user customizations at:**
`~/.claude/skills/PAI/USER/SKILLCUSTOMIZATIONS/BmadOrchestrate/`

If this directory exists, load and apply any PREFERENCES.md, configurations, or resources found there. These override default behavior. If the directory does not exist, proceed with skill defaults.

## Voice Notification

**When executing a workflow, do BOTH:**

1. **Send voice notification**:
   ```bash
   curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8888/notify \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"message": "Running WORKFLOWNAME in BmadOrchestrate to ACTION"}' \
     > /dev/null 2>&1 &
   ```

2. **Output text notification**:
   ```
   Running the **WorkflowName** workflow in the **BmadOrchestrate** skill to ACTION...
   ```

## Workflow Routing

| Workflow | Trigger | File |
|----------|---------|------|
| **Analyze** | "analyze for parallelization", "find parallel stories", "dependency graph" | `Workflows/Analyze.md` |
| **Execute** | "execute parallel", "launch worktrees", "run stories in parallel" | `Workflows/Execute.md` |
| **Merge** | "merge worktrees", "combine branches", "merge parallel work" | `Workflows/Merge.md` |

## Examples

**Example 1: Full orchestration from bmad-help output**
```
User: "Parallelize the remaining Epic 4 stories"
→ Invokes Analyze workflow
→ Reads sprint-status.yaml + epics.md
→ Builds dependency graph, identifies 4-2 ‖ 4-4 as independent
→ Presents phase plan with parallel tracks
→ User approves → Invokes Execute workflow
→ Creates worktrees, launches tmux + Claude Code instances
```

**Example 2: Analyze only**
```
User: "Which stories can I run in parallel?"
→ Invokes Analyze workflow
→ Reads sprint status and epic definitions
→ Returns dependency graph + parallelization opportunities
→ Does NOT execute (analysis only)
```

**Example 3: Merge completed worktrees**
```
User: "Merge the parallel story branches back"
→ Invokes Merge workflow
→ Lists worktree branches with changes
→ Merges sequentially, resolving sprint-status.yaml conflicts
→ Cleans up worktrees
```

## Quick Reference

- **Dependency detection:** Reads acceptance criteria for cross-story references
- **Conflict hotspot:** `sprint-status.yaml` — always needs manual merge
- **Worktree location:** `.claude/worktrees/` (Claude Code default)
- **tmux session name:** `bmad-epic-{N}` where N is the active epic number

### Execution Modes

| Mode | Method | Requirement | Isolation |
|------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Agent Teams** (preferred) | `Agent` tool with `isolation: "worktree"` | `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` env var set | Automatic git worktree per agent |
| **tmux** (fallback) | Manual worktree + tmux panes | tmux installed, no `CLAUDECODE` env var blocking | Manual git worktree creation |

Agent Teams is preferred when available — it handles worktree creation, isolation, and cleanup automatically.
