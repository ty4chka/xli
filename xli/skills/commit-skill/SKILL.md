# Commit and Push Skill

1. Stage only files related to the current task
2. Run `git commit --no-verify` if pre-commit hooks fail on unrelated issues
3. Push to the current branch
4. Report the commit hash and branch name

NOTE: This repo uses Azure DevOps. For PRs use `az repos pr create`.
NOTE: The `commit-msg` hook strips `Co-Authored-By` trailers so commits appear as sole-author.
